autofs-5.1.8 - fix fix mount tree startup reconnect

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

In function master_mount_mounts() commit 635b90eccee9 checks if the
current top level mount is already running by using two things, if the
mount handling thread id is set in the autofs mount point structure and
if the mount point path is a mounted autofs file system.

But the top level master map entry for a direct mount map is the
reserved path "/-" and doesn't have an actual mount associated with it
so a mounted check can't be used. But we know that top level mounts
start in state ST_INIT and once that state is changed it never changes
back to it. So using the presence of the mount handling thread id and
the state not being ST_INIT is sufficient to know if this is a new
mount or not.
