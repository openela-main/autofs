autofs-5.1.8 - dont delay expire

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

There's a delay on expire of submounts that can be as much as the
expire timeout. This was originally an attempt to reduce re-reading
the map but it can cause very long delays on expire.

So get rid of the delay and allow submounts to expire normally.
