autofs-5.1.7 - refactor lookup_prune_one_cache() a bit

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

Coverity: use: Using an unreliable value of "me" inside the second locked
	  section.

Change lookup_prune_one_cache() a little, move the location the next
key is set (before releasing the lock) and add a comment explaining
why we don't care about the side effects of the read lock release/
write lock aquire/write lock release/read lock reaquire.
